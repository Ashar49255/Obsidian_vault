## **1. What is NGINX?**

- NGINX (pronounced "Engine-X") is a **web server**.
    
- It can also be used as a **reverse proxy, load balancer, and cache server**.
    
- Basically, it helps your website or web app handle **lots of visitors** efficiently.
    

---

## **2. Why we use NGINX?**

- **Fast:** Handles thousands of connections at the same time.
    
- **Lightweight:** Doesn’t use too much memory.
    
- **Flexible:** Can act as a web server, reverse proxy, or load balancer.
    
- **Reliable:** Often used in big websites like Netflix, Google, and Airbnb.

## **3. How NGINX works (simple version)**

Imagine your website is a **restaurant**:

1. Visitors are **customers**.
    
2. NGINX is the **reception**: it takes requests from customers.
    
3. It either:
    
    - **Serves the food itself** (like serving static files: HTML, CSS, images), or
        
    - **Passes the request to the kitchen** (like sending dynamic requests to your app, e.g., Python Flask, Node.js).
        

This is why it’s called a **reverse proxy** when passing requests to your app server.

## **4. NGINX vs Apache (easy comparison)**

|Feature|NGINX|Apache|
|---|---|---|
|Performance|Very fast|Slower under heavy traffic|
|Handling traffic|Event-driven (many users at once)|Process-based (uses more memory)|
|Static files|Fast|Slower|
|Dynamic files|Pass to another server|Can handle itself|

---

## **5. Basic NGINX Usage**

1. **Install NGINX**
    

`sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx`

2. **Start NGINX**
    

`sudo systemctl start nginx`

3. **Check status**
    

`sudo systemctl status nginx`

4. **Visit in browser**
    

- Go to `http://localhost`
    
- You will see the default NGINX page.
    

5. **Stop NGINX**
    

`sudo systemctl stop nginx`

---

## **6. Where NGINX stores files**

- **Configuration files:** `/etc/nginx/`
    
- **Web files (HTML, images):** `/var/www/html/`
    

---

## **7. NGINX is used for**

- Hosting websites
    
- Serving static files fast
    
- Acting as a reverse proxy (sending requests to app servers)
    
- Load balancing (sharing traffic across multiple servers)

## **1. Forward Proxy (Client Side Proxy)**

### **What is it?**

- Forward Proxy sits **in front of users (clients)**.
    
- It hides the **client** from the internet.
    

### **Simple Example**

Imagine:

- You (user) want to visit **google.com**
    
- You are not allowed directly
    
- You send request to a **proxy server**
    
- Proxy server sends request to Google **on your behalf**
    

👉 Google **does NOT know who you are**, it only sees the proxy.

### **Flow**

`User → Forward Proxy → Internet/Website`

### **Why use Forward Proxy?**

- Hide user identity (privacy)
    
- Control internet usage (schools, offices)
    
- Block websites
    
- Cache websites to save bandwidth
    

### **Real-life Example**

- Office internet restrictions
    
- VPN (mostly works like forward proxy)
    

---

## **2. Reverse Proxy (Server Side Proxy)**

### **What is it?**

- Reverse Proxy sits **in front of servers**.
    
- It hides the **backend servers** from users.
    

### **Simple Example**

Imagine:

- User opens **your website**
    
- Request first goes to **NGINX**
    
- NGINX forwards it to:
    
    - App server
        
    - Backend server
        
    - Database server
        

👉 User **never knows** which server handled the request.

### **Flow**

`User → Reverse Proxy (NGINX) → Backend Servers`

### **Why use Reverse Proxy?**

- Load balancing
    
- Security (hide backend servers)
    
- SSL handling (HTTPS)
    
- Better performance
    
- Caching
    

### **Real-life Example**

- NGINX
    
- HAProxy
    
- AWS Load Balancer

## **3️⃣ Reverse Proxy vs Forward Proxy**

|Feature|Reverse Proxy|Forward Proxy|
|---|---|---|
|**Location**|In front of **servers**|In front of **clients**|
|**Purpose**|Protect and manage servers|Protect and manage clients|
|**Visibility**|Client sees proxy as the server|Server sees proxy as the client|
|**Common Use**|Load balancing, caching, SSL termination|Anonymity, internet filtering, bypass restrictions|
|**Who it serves**|Backend servers|Clients|

---

💡 **Easy way to remember:**

- **Reverse Proxy** = Protects the **server side**.
    
- **Forward Proxy** = Protects the **client side**.

# **What is the different between the Apache web server and Nginx**

### **Key Differences Explained**

1. **Architecture & Performance**
    
    - Apache: Every new connection creates a new **process or thread** → memory heavy under high traffic.
        
    - Nginx: Uses **event-driven asynchronous model** → can handle **10,000+ connections** with minimal memory.
        
2. **Serving Static vs Dynamic Content**
    
    - Apache: Can serve static and dynamic content directly using modules like mod_php.
        
    - Nginx: Super fast for static content, but for dynamic content, it forwards requests to backend servers (Python, PHP, Node.js).
        
3. **Configuration & Flexibility**
    
    - Apache: `.htaccess` allows directory-level config changes → good for shared hosting.
        
    - Nginx: Centralized config only → more efficient and faster, but no per-directory overrides.
        
4. **Use Cases in Industry**
    
    - Apache: Good for **legacy apps, shared hosting, PHP-heavy websites**.
        
    - Nginx: Best for **high traffic websites, microservices, cloud apps, load balancing, reverse proxy setups**
