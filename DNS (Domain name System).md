## What is DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through [domain names](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) addresses. DNS translates domain names to [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so browsers can load Internet resources.

### How Does DNS Work? (Easy English)

DNS changes a website name into an IP address.
For example:
- Website name: **[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)**
- IP address: **192.168.1.1**    
Every device on the Internet has an IP address.  
An IP address is like a **home address**.  
Without an address, you cannot find a house.  
In the same way, without an IP address, a website cannot be found.
